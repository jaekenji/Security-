## Process

###### Preparation > Detection and Analysis > Containment, Eradication, and Recovery > Post-Incident Activity
### Preparation 
###### All components needed to effectively respond to an incident are identified, acquiredm or created.
### Detection and Analysis
###### Focuses on detection and discovery of indicators of compromise (IOC)
### Containment, Eradication, and Recovery
###### After stopping the problem from getting worse, you limit damage, regain control, then restore systems.
### Post-Incident Recovery
###### Learn to improve from the incident and prevent this from happening again.

## Training
###### Training is critical for equipping your team with the skills and knmowledge they need to manage and mitigate security incidents effectively.
### Testing
###### Refers to systematic and rigorous examination of an orginizations incident response capabilities.
```cmd
Scenario Design  :: Hypothetical
Role Assignment  :: Each participant assigned a role that corresponds to a real-world counterpart
Time Constraints :: Real incidents don't let you have time
Decision Points  :: Moments the exercise is paused to evaluate the actions taken to a point
Documentation    :: Serves as an audit trail
```

## Testing
### Simulation
##### Environment
###### Isolated replica of your network
##### External Injects
###### Unexpected elements
##### Metrics
###### (KPIs) Key performance indicators used to evaluate effectiveness.
##### Debriefing
###### "Hotwash" "AAR"

## Root Cause Analysis
###### Critical, identify the underlying reasons behind a security incident.

## Threat Huntung
###### Proactive ceybersecurity, searching through networks and data sets to detect advanced threats.

## Digital Forensics
###### Approach to uncovering, analyzing, and preserving evidence.
### Legal Hold
###### Process of preserving electronically stored information.
### Chain of Custody
###### Provides a clear record of the path that evidence takes from acquisition to disposal.
### Acquisition
###### Collection of evidence from various sources to ensure integrity for analysis.
### Reporting
###### Documentaion of all activities and findings throughout the forensics process.
### Preservation
###### Involves safeguarding evidence from the moment it is identified until end of it's life cycle
### E-discovery
###### Electronic discovery, identifying, collecting, and producing electronically stored information.
