## Process

###### Preparation > Detection and Analysis > Containment, Eradication, and Recovery > Post-Incident Activity
### Preparation 
###### All components needed to effectively respond to an incident are identified, acquiredm or created.
### Detection and Analysis
###### Focuses on detection and discovery of indicators of compromise (IOC)
### Containment, Eradication, and Recovery
###### After stopping the problem from getting worse, you limit damage, regain control, then restore systems.
### Post-Incident Recovery
###### Learn to improve from the incident and prevent this from happening again.

## Training
###### Training is critical for equipping your team with the skills and knmowledge they need to manage and mitigate security incidents effectively.
### Testing
###### Refers to systematic and rigorous examination of an orginizations incident response capabilities.
```cmd
Scenario Design  :: Hypothetical
Role Assignment  :: Each participant assigned a role that corresponds to a real-world counterpart
Time Constraints :: Real incidents don't let you have time
Decision Points  :: Moments the exercise is paused to evaluate the actions taken to a point
Documentation    :: Serves as an audit trail
```

## Testing
### Simulation
##### Environment
###### Isolated replica of your network
##### External Injects
###### Unexpected elements
##### Metrics
###### (KPIs) Key performance indicators used to evaluate effectiveness.
##### Debriefing
###### "Hotwash" "AAR"

## Root Cause Analysis
###### Critical, identify the underlying reasons behind a security incident.

## Threat Huntung
###### Proactive ceybersecurity, searching through networks and data sets to detect advanced threats.

## Digital Forensics
###### Approach to uncovering, analyzing, and preserving evidence.
### Legal Hold
###### Process of preserving electronically stored information.
### Chain of Custody
###### Provides a clear record of the path that evidence takes from acquisition to disposal.
### Acquisition
###### Collection of evidence from various sources to ensure integrity for analysis.
### Reporting
###### Documentaion of all activities and findings throughout the forensics process.
### Preservation
###### Involves safeguarding evidence from the moment it is identified until end of it's life cycle
### E-discovery
###### Electronic discovery, identifying, collecting, and producing electronically stored information.

# Using Data to support an Investigation
###### [Log Data](##log-data)
###### [Data Sources](##data-sources)

## Log Data
###### Refers to systematically recorded inforation generated by software applications, operating systems, or hardware devices.
### Firewall Logs
###### Monitoring traffic allowed or denied through a network's firewall
```example
2024-12-10 09:13:00 ALLOW TCP 192.168.1.1 8.8.8.8 443
2024-12-10 09:13:00 DENY TCP 203.0.113.42 192.168.10.2 4444
```
### Application Logs
###### Contains records of services, events, and systems within an application.
### Endpoint Logs
###### Detailed information about activities on individual devices.
### Operating System security Logs
###### Each system has logs that contain log records for the operating system.
```example
Windows :: Event Viewer
Linux   :: /var/log
```
### (IPS) and (IDS) Logs
###### Specialized records that identify potentially harmful activities within a network.
### Network Logs
###### Capture data traffic that traverse the network infrastructure.
### Metadata
###### Every activity you perform creates metadata.
