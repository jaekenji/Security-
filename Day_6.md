# Enhance Security

## Firewall

### Rules
###### Exist to control the flow of data.
```
ALLOW TCP from ANY to 203.0.113.5 PORT 80
```
### Access Control List (ACL)
###### Is a fundamental feature of firewall technology. 
###### ACLs can be used to allow or deny: IPs, Protocols, Ports, Time of Day.
### Ports
###### Like a virtual dock used by a running program to service outside users.
### Protocol
###### Set series of steps or ways of doing things.
### Screened Subnet
###### Specific network segment situated between an organization and internal network.

## Intrusion Detection System (IDS) / Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)
### Signatures
###### Such as hashes of specific chunks of a file.
### Web Filtering
###### A mechanism that controls access to websites.
### Agent-Based Web Filtering
###### Software on the users device to filter.
### Centralized Proxy
###### Server based method of web filtering.
### URL Scanning
###### A process that involves examining and categorizing web addresses to see potentially harmful websites.
### Content Categorization
###### Instead of straight up blocking, examines content within the site.
### Block Rules
###### Black lists. Predifined rules.

## OS Security
### Group Policy
###### Framework for admins to make rules for the OS
### SELinux
###### Policies and Sandboxing for linux applications to run in.
### Protocol Selection
###### Choosing a standard to communicate of send data over.
### Port Selection
###### Choosing specific entry and exit points

###### Blocking access to particular domain resolutions

## Email Security
###### Secure access and content of an email account/service
### Domain-Based Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance (DMARC)
###### CRITCAL in combatting email-based attacks
