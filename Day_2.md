### Chapter 1: Cryptographioc Solutions
> Encryption, Tools, KGs, Key Management Systems, Obfuscation, Block Chain

#### 1. Encryption

##### PKIs
- Asymmetric Key Pair (Private/Public)

##### Things typically encrypted:
- Full Disk Encryption (Full)
- Partition (Partial)
- File (Specific)
- Volume (Large)
- Database (WAF Web Application Firewall)
- Record (Individual Units of Data)
- Transport Communication (Data at Rest, Date in Route, Data in Use)

##### Symmetric v Asymmetric
- Symmetic -> Same Key
- Asymmetric -> Use different keys
###### Diffie Hellman
  - A public key is agreed upon
  - Both parties choose a random key
  - Both parties encrypt a the public key with their private key and exchange that information
  - Both parties encrypt this new information with their randomly selected key
  - This new information is a private key shared by both parties

##### Algorithms
- Stream ciphers, one bit at a time
- Block cipher, encrypts a large block

#### 2. Tools

##### Hardware Security Module
- TPM chip

##### Key Management System
##### Secure Enclave

#### 3. Obfuscation

##### Steganography

##### Tokenization

##### Data Masking

#### 4. Hashing

#### 5. Digital Signatures

#### 6. Key Stretching

#### 7. Blockcahining
- Digital ledger of all transactions that occur

#### 8. Cetificate Authorities 
- .BER
- .CER
- .DER
- .PEM
