#### 1. Encryption

##### PKIs
- Asymmetric Key Pair (Private/Public)

##### Things typically encrypted:
- Full Disk Encryption (Full)
- Partition (Partial)
- File (Specific)
- Volume (Large)
- Database (WAF Web Application Firewall)
- Record (Individual Units of Data)
- Transport Communication (Data at Rest, Date in Route, Data in Use)

##### Symmetric v Asymmetric
- Symmetic -> Same Key
- Asymmetric -> Use different keys
  - A public key is agreed upon
  - Both parties choose a random key
  - Both parties encrypt a the public key with their private key and exchange that information
  - Both parties encrypt this new information with their randomly selected key
  - This new information is a private key shared by both parties
